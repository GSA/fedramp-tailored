# IA-2(1) Identification and Authentication (Organization Users) | Network Access to Privileged Accounts
## IA-2(1) Control Requirement
The information system implements multifactor authentication for network access to privileged accounts.
## IA-2(1) Control Objective
The objective/ intent of this control is to identify the process by which the system implements multifactor authentication for network access to privileged accounts. The mistake often made when describing this control is that all accesses to privileged accounts are via network access unless the user is logged into the device directly from a terminal console which is rarely accomplished anymore. NIST supplemental guidance provides the definition of “network access is access to organizational information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is obtained through network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access that involves communication through external networks (e.g., the Internet). Internal networks include local area networks and wide area networks. In addition, the use of encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) for network connections between organization-controlled endpoints and non-organization controlled endpoints may be treated as internal networks from the perspective of protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information traversing the network.”

Therefore all access to privileged accounts must be via multifactor authentication.
## IA-2(1) Write the Control
Describe the process by which the system implements (noun) multi-factor authentication for (noun) network access to (noun) privileged accounts, at leach level of each service layer for which the CSP is responsible. Keep in mind that network access is primarily the only way that access is granted unless the privileged user is logged in to the device console directly. FedRAMP requires that the multi-factor for AAL2 be FIPS 140 Level 2 or NSA Approved.

NIST 800-63b states, “When a device such a smartphone is used in the authentication process, the unlocking of that device (typically done using a PIN or biometric) SHALL NOT be considered one of the authentication factors. Generally, it is not possible for a verifier to know that the device had been locked or if the unlock process met the requirements for the relevant authenticator type.”

When an AAL2 multifactor authenticator is used, any of the following MAY be used:
  *	MultiFactor OTP Device (Section 5.1.5 - A multifactor OTP device generates OTPs for use in authentication after activation through an additional authentication factor.)
  *	MultiFactor Cryptographic Software (Section 5.1.8 - A multifactor software cryptographic authenticator is a cryptographic key stored on disk or some other "soft" media that requires activation through a second factor of authentication.)
  *	MultiFactor Cryptographic Device (Section 5.1.9 – multifactor cryptographic device is a hardware device that performs cryptographic operations using one or more protected cryptographic keys and requires activation through a second authentication factor.)
