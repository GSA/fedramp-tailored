# AC-17 Remote Access

## Control Requirement


## Control Objective
Currently, all access to cloud systems is remote and most cloud systems implement automated mechanisms to facilitate the monitoring and control of these remote access methods. Automated monitoring of remote access sessions allows CSPs to audit user activities on a variety of information system components (i.e., servers, workstations, laptops) and to ensure compliance with CSP remote access policy. As required, the CSP uses cryptography to protect the confidentiality and integrity of remote access sessions.

The objective/intent of this section of the control is to ensure that the CSP has identified the types of remote access allowed to the cloud system at all service levels. There must be a full accounting of all types of remote access allowed. There must be a full accounting of all methods of remote access, before continuing with this security control implementation detail.

Once all methods of remote access are identified, the CSP must describe for each type of remote access allowed, the established usage restrictions; the established configuration/connection requirements; and the implementation guidance. Ideally, this information is already captured in a document devoted to remote access or the system access management methodology. If the documentation already exists, the summation can be described in the implementation detail along with the proper citations as indicated below.
