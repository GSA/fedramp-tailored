# CA-7 Continuous Monitoring
## CA-7 Control Requirement
The organization develops a continuous monitoring strategy and implements a continuous monitoring program that includes:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)	Establishment of [*Assignment: organization-defined metrics*] to be monitored;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)	Establishment of [*Assignment: organization-defined frequencies*] for monitoring and [*Assignment: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;organization-defined frequencies*] for assessments supporting such monitoring;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)	Ongoing security control assessments in accordance with the organizational continuous monitoring strategy;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)	Ongoing security status monitoring of organization-defined metrics in accordance with the organizational &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continuous monitoring strategy;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)	Correlation and analysis of security-related information generated by assessments and monitoring;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)	Response actions to address results of the analysis of security-related information; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)	Reporting the security status of organization and the information system to [*FedRAMP Assignment: to meet &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal and FedRAMP requirements*] [*Assignment: organization-defined frequency*].

**CA-7 Additional FedRAMP Requirements and Guidance:** CSPs must provide evidence of closure and remediation of a high vulnerability within the timeframe for standard POA&M updates.
### CA-7(a) Control Requirement
Describe how the organization develops a continuous monitoring strategy and implements a continuous monitoring program that includes establishment of [Assignment: organization-defined metrics] to be monitored.

There is a FedRAMP additional requirement for this control.

**CA-7 Requirement:** Operating System Scans: at least monthly; Database and Web Application Scans: at least monthly; All scans performed by Independent Assessor: at least annually.

There is a FedRAMP additional guidance for this control.

**CA-7 Guidance:** CSPs must provide evidence of closure and remediation of high vulnerabilities within the timeframe for standard POA&M updates. Operating System Scans: at least monthly Database and Web Application Scans: at least monthly. All scans performed by Independent Assessor: at least annually.
### CA-7(a) Control Objective
The objective/ intent of this control is to define the CSP continuous monitoring effort in alignment with the NIST guidelines and FedRAMP requirements. Continuous monitoring must be performed for the entire CSO between each layer and at each level. As such, it is necessary to determine if the CSP requirements for continuous monitoring are stable across each level of each service layer. This means that the requirement must describe how the organization develops a continuous monitoring strategy and implements a continuous monitoring program that includes establishment of organization-defined metrics to be monitored that will align with the FedRAMP requirements as follows:

**_Operating System Scans:_** at least monthly with evidence of closure and remediation of high vulnerabilities within the timeframe for standard POA&M updates which is 30 days for high vulnerabilities (and 90 days for Moderate vulnerabilities. Low vulnerabilities must be addressed by the next annual assessment.)

**_Database and Web Application Scans:_** at least monthly with evidence of closure and remediation of high vulnerabilities within the timeframe for standard POA&M updates which is 30 days for high vulnerabilities (and 90 days for Moderate vulnerabilities. Low vulnerabilities must be addressed by the next annual assessment.)

**_All scans performed by Independent Assessor:_** at least annually with evidence of closure and remediation of high vulnerabilities within the timeframe for standard POA&M updates which is 30 days for high vulnerabilities (and 90 days for Moderate vulnerabilities. Low vulnerabilities must be addressed by the next annual assessment.)

Please determine if the continuous monitoring for each level is accomplished in the same manner. For instance, if the CSO is a SaaS, is the continuous monitoring accomplished in the same manner for both the Application and the Data levels? If it is not, please explain. If the PaaS continuous monitoring is accomplished in a manner that differs, please explain the rationale between each level in the PaaS and then each of the levels in the IaaS.
### CA-7(a) Write the Control
NIST Supplemental guidance for this control states, “The terms continuous and ongoing imply that organizations assess/analyze security controls and information security-related risks at a frequency sufficient to support organizational risk-based decisions.”
In order to appropriately address the continuous monitoring security control implementation detail, this requirement must describe how the organization develops a continuous monitoring strategy and implements a continuous monitoring program that includes establishment of the FedRAMP requirements at each level of the service offering for which the CSP is responsible.

If the CSP differentiates continuous monitoring at each level, this outline should be provided in the security control implementation description to fully illustrate to the reader and to the assessors how each level is handled.

Here is a succinct accounting of the control writing requirement at each level of each layer:
* (a.1) DEVELOP & DEFINE STRATEGY – Has the CSP developed the continuous monitoring strategy that defines appropriate FedRAMP metrics?
* (a.2) INCLUDE METRICS – Has the CSP monitoring strategy included a monitoring strategy for those defined metrics?
* (a.3) IMPLEMENT STRATEGY WITH METRICS – Has the CSP implemented this continuous monitoring program that includes monitoring of organization-defined metrics in accordance with the organizational continuous monitoring strategy?

If the CSP has determined that continuous monitoring is LESS granular and there is one over-arching policy and procedure governing all of continuous monitoring, that can be stated as well but with the detail required.

For each level of the CSO, describe the “developed”, “defined”, “included”, and “implemented” as follows:

(i)	How the CSP had developed and has defined a continuous monitoring strategy that defines metrics to be monitored as per the FedRAMP requirements for scanning Infrastructure/Operating Systems, Web applications, Databases, and allows for the 3PAO to ensure annual scanning and with evidence of closure and remediation of high vulnerabilities within the timeframe for standard POA&M updates which is 30 days for high vulnerabilities (and 90 days for Moderate vulnerabilities. Low vulnerabilities must be addressed by the next annual assessment.)

(ii)	How the CSP has actually included these metrics and implemented this strategy in a provable manner, and does continuous monitoring based upon these defined metrics.
### CA-7(a) Customer Responsibilities
*IaaS* – This responsibility lies with Service Provider System Specific, or possibly Service Provider Hybrid (Service Provider Corporate and Service Provider System Specific) but there is no customer responsibility for the CSP to develop a continuous monitoring strategy and implement a continuous monitoring program for the CSO.

*PaaS* – This responsibility lies with Service Provider System Specific, or possibly Service Provider Hybrid (Service Provider Corporate and Service Provider System Specific) but there is no customer responsibility for the CSP to develop a continuous monitoring strategy and implement a continuous monitoring program for the CSO.

*SaaS* – This responsibility lies with Service Provider System Specific, or possibly Service Provider Hybrid (Service Provider Corporate and Service Provider System Specific) but there is no customer responsibility for the CSP to develop a continuous monitoring strategy and implement a continuous monitoring program for the CSO.
### CA-7(b) Control Requirement
Describe how the organization develops a continuous monitoring strategy and implements a continuous monitoring program that includes establishment of [Assignment: organization-defined frequencies] for monitoring and [Assignment: organization-defined frequencies] for assessments supporting such monitoring.
 
As stated in part (a) of this control, CA-7 Requirement: **Operating System Scans: at least monthly; Database and Web Application Scans: at least monthly; All scans performed by Independent Assessor: at least annually.**

There is FedRAMP additional guidance for this control.

As stated in part (a) of this control, CA-7 Guidance: **CSPs must provide evidence of closure and remediation of high vulnerabilities within the timeframe for standard POA&M updates.**

**Operating System Scans: at least monthly**

**Database and Web Application Scans: at least monthly**

**All scans performed by Independent Assessor: at least annually.**
### CA-7(b) Control Objective
The objective/ intent of this part (b) is focused on the requirements for monitoring the adherence to the continuous monitoring program established in part (a). Each CSP must have mechanisms in place to ensure that the continuous monitoring is being done for the CSO, according to the FedRAMP requirements.

NIST Supplemental guidance states, “The results of continuous monitoring programs generate appropriate risk response actions by organizations. Continuous monitoring programs also allow organizations to maintain the security authorizations of information systems and common controls over time in highly dynamic environments of operation with changing mission/business needs, threats, vulnerabilities, and technologies.”

Therefore, if the monitoring is not being accomplished for adherence to the continuous monitoring program, the organization will not be generating “appropriate risk response actions”.
### CA-7(b) Write the Control
Security control nuances are sometimes “tricky” to recognize. This is why a CSP writing the SSP cannot just say, “Yes we do this” in a security control implementation detail.

In part (a) of this control, we wrote to the following:

(a.1) DEVELOP & DEFINE STRATEGY – Has the CSP _**developed**_ the continuous monitoring strategy that _**defines**_ appropriate FedRAMP metrics?

(a.2) INCLUDE METRICS – Has the CSP monitoring strategy _**included**_ a monitoring strategy for those defined metrics?

(a.3) IMPLEMENT STRATEGY WITH METRICS – Has the CSP _**implemented**_ this continuous monitoring program that includes monitoring of organization-defined metrics in accordance with the organizational continuous monitoring strategy?

There are 3 nouns **(frequencies, strategy, program)** that must be addressed in this part (b) of the control. The requirement is to describe how the **frequencies** in the **strategy** defined in part (a) are part of the continuous monitoring **program.**

The verb is **monitor.**

The **program** must have **specifically defined frequencies for monitoring** and **specifically defined frequencies for monitoring to support monitoring.**

The strategy and the program must be monitored (at the frequencies/metrics defined by FedRAMP OR may be MORE STRINGENT metrics if the CSP has defined more provable, stringent requirements) to ensure that the strategy and the program support the monitoring. Therefore, describe how the continuous monitoring is monitored for effectiveness and efficiency. In other words, if the continuous monitoring strategy and program flow breaks down, how will the CSP know this has happened?
### CA-7(b) Customer Responsibilities
*IaaS* – This responsibility lies with Service Provider System Specific, or possibly Service Provider Hybrid (Service Provider Corporate and Service Provider System Specific) but there is no customer responsibility for the CSP to develop a continuous monitoring strategy and implement a continuous monitoring program for the CSO.

*PaaS* – This responsibility lies with Service Provider System Specific, or possibly Service Provider Hybrid (Service Provider Corporate and Service Provider System Specific) but there is no customer responsibility for the CSP to develop a continuous monitoring strategy and implement a continuous monitoring program for the CSO.

*SaaS* – This responsibility lies with Service Provider System Specific, or possibly Service Provider Hybrid (Service Provider Corporate and Service Provider System Specific) but there is no customer responsibility for the CSP to develop a continuous monitoring strategy and implement a continuous monitoring program for the CSO.
### CA-7(c) Control Requirement
Describe how the organization develops a continuous monitoring strategy and implements a continuous monitoring program that includes ongoing security control assessments in accordance with the organizational continuous monitoring strategy.

As stated in part (a) of this control, CA-7 Requirement: **Operating System Scans: at least monthly; Database and Web Application Scans: at least monthly; All scans performed by Independent Assessor: at least annually.**

There is FedRAMP additional guidance for this control.

As stated in part (a) of this control, CA-7 Guidance: **CSPs must provide evidence of closure and remediation of high vulnerabilities within the timeframe for standard POA&M updates.**

**Operating System Scans: at least monthly**

**Database and Web Application Scans: at least monthly**

**All scans performed by Independent Assessor: at least annually.**
### CA-7(c) Control Objective
The objective/intent of this part (c) is focused on security control assessments and ensuring that these assessments are being accomplished at the FedRAMP defined frequency as part of the continuous monitoring strategy.

Part (a) establishes the continuous monitoring strategy and program. Part (b) establishes the requirements for monitoring the adherence to the continuous monitoring program established in part (a). Each CSP must have mechanisms in place to ensure that the continuous monitoring is being done for the CSO, according to the FedRAMP requirements.

Do not repeat what is already stated in parts (a), and (b). Focus on describing the security control assessments that are accomplished at the FedRAMP-defined frequency which is “annually” or whenever there is a significant change.
### CA-7(c) Write the Control
The requirement for part (c) is that the continuous monitoring strategy must include ongoing security control assessments which are integral in maintaining the security authorization of the system. FedRAMP requires annual security control assessments or more often based upon the significant changes within the system.

Write the requirement for part (c) based upon the continuous monitoring strategy which must include the security control assessment requirement.

Focus on two nouns – **strategy, security control assessments.**

Focus on two verbs – **developed and implemented.**

The control implementation description must be written to establish that the **continuous monitoring strategy (Included in the program) have developed and implemented security control assessments** as an integral part of continuous monitoring. Then write to how this can be substantiated and the assessments are actually being accomplished in the manner prescribed by the strategy and FedRAMP requirements or stricter requirements. There should be a statement regarding the FedRAMP requirements and not just a statement that says, “…we follow FedRAMP requirements”.  Be specific.
### CA-7(c) Customer Responsibilities
*IaaS* – This responsibility lies with Service Provider System Specific, or possibly Service Provider Hybrid (Service Provider Corporate and Service Provider System Specific) but there is no customer responsibility for the CSP to develop a continuous monitoring strategy and implement a continuous monitoring program for the CSO.

*PaaS* – This responsibility lies with Service Provider System Specific, or possibly Service Provider Hybrid (Service Provider Corporate and Service Provider System Specific) but there is no customer responsibility for the CSP to develop a continuous monitoring strategy and implement a continuous monitoring program for the CSO.

*SaaS* – This responsibility lies with Service Provider System Specific, or possibly Service Provider Hybrid (Service Provider Corporate and Service Provider System Specific) but there is no customer responsibility for the CSP to develop a continuous monitoring strategy and implement a continuous monitoring program for the CSO.
### CA-7(d) Control Requirement
Describe how the organization develops a continuous monitoring strategy and implements a continuous monitoring program that includes ongoing security status monitoring of organization-defined metrics in accordance with the organizational continuous monitoring strategy.

As stated in part (a) of this control, CA-7 Requirement: **Operating System Scans: at least monthly; Database and Web Application Scans: at least monthly; All scans performed by Independent Assessor: at least annually.**

There is FedRAMP additional guidance for this control.

As stated in part (a) of this control, CA-7 Guidance: **CSPs must provide evidence of closure and remediation of high vulnerabilities within the timeframe for standard POA&M updates.**

**Operating System Scans: at least monthly**

**Database and Web Application Scans: at least monthly**

**All scans performed by Independent Assessor: at least annually.**
### CA-7(d) Control Objective
The objective/intent of this control is to ensure that another nuance of continuous monitoring is described - **ongoing security status monitoring of organization-defined metrics**. Most organizations now accomplish this ”security status monitoring” through dashboards and near real-time reporting capabilities.

NIST supplemental Guidance states, “...Having access to security-related information on a continuing basis through reports/dashboards gives organizational officials the capability to make more effective and timely risk management decisions, including ongoing security authorization decisions.”
### CA-7(d) Write the Control
Focus on the verb “**security status monitoring**” and the noun “**metrics**” encompassed in this phrase “**security status monitoring of organization-defined metrics**”.

As with any activity, one must first develop the activity. Then once developed, the activity must be executed or implemented.

Describe how the organization had developed the continuous monitoring strategy to include this “security status monitoring of organization-defined metrics”. Then describe how this security status monitoring is implemented or executed within the environment.
### CA-7(d) Customer Responsibilities
*IaaS* – This responsibility lies with Service Provider System Specific, or possibly Service Provider Hybrid (Service Provider Corporate and Service Provider System Specific) but there is no customer responsibility for the CSP to develop a continuous monitoring strategy and implement a continuous monitoring program for the CSO.

*PaaS* – This responsibility lies with Service Provider System Specific, or possibly Service Provider Hybrid (Service Provider Corporate and Service Provider System Specific) but there is no customer responsibility for the CSP to develop a continuous monitoring strategy and implement a continuous monitoring program for the CSO.

*SaaS* – This responsibility lies with Service Provider System Specific, or possibly Service Provider Hybrid (Service Provider Corporate and Service Provider System Specific) but there is no customer responsibility for the CSP to develop a continuous monitoring strategy and implement a continuous monitoring program for the CSO.
### CA-7(e) Control Requirement
Describe how the organization develops a continuous monitoring strategy and implements a continuous monitoring program that includes correlation and analysis of security-related information generated by assessments and monitoring.

As stated in part (a) of this control, CA-7 Requirement: **Operating System Scans: at least monthly; Database and Web Application Scans: at least monthly; All scans performed by Independent Assessor: at least annually.**

There is FedRAMP additional guidance for this control.

As stated in part (a) of this control, CA-7 Guidance: **CSPs must provide evidence of closure and remediation of high vulnerabilities within the timeframe for standard POA&M updates.**

**Operating System Scans: at least monthly**

**Database and Web Application Scans: at least monthly**

**All scans performed by Independent Assessor: at least annually.**
### CA-7(e) Control Objective
The objective/intent of this part (e) of this control is another nuance of continuous monitoring - **correlation and analysis of security-related information generated by assessments and monitoring.**
### CA-7(e) Write the Control
As with any activity, one must first develop the activity. Then once developed, the activity must be executed or implemented.

Focus on two verbs **(correlation and analysis) of (noun) security-related information generated by assessments and monitoring**.

Continuous monitoring strategy and program aspects are not truly usable unless data is correlated and analyzed. This will provide the information that is “specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and timely”.

Describe how the continuous monitoring assessment and monitoring provide “specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and timely” data and information through correlation and analysis, which the organization uses to support the risk management program. Describe how the process for correlation and analysis was developed and then how it is implemented.

NIST Supplemental guidance states, “…Automation supports more frequent updates to security authorization packages, hardware/software/firmware inventories, and other system information. Effectiveness is further enhanced when continuous monitoring outputs are formatted to provide information that is specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and timely. Continuous monitoring activities are scaled in accordance with the security categories of information systems.”
### CA-7(e) Customer Responsibilities
*IaaS* – This responsibility lies with Service Provider System Specific, or possibly Service Provider Hybrid (Service Provider Corporate and Service Provider System Specific) but there is no customer responsibility for the CSP to develop a continuous monitoring strategy and implement a continuous monitoring program for the CSO.

*PaaS* – This responsibility lies with Service Provider System Specific, or possibly Service Provider Hybrid (Service Provider Corporate and Service Provider System Specific) but there is no customer responsibility for the CSP to develop a continuous monitoring strategy and implement a continuous monitoring program for the CSO.

*SaaS* – This responsibility lies with Service Provider System Specific, or possibly Service Provider Hybrid (Service Provider Corporate and Service Provider System Specific) but there is no customer responsibility for the CSP to develop a continuous monitoring strategy and implement a continuous monitoring program for the CSO.
