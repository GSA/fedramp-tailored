# CM-8 Information System Component Inventory
## CM-8 Control Requirement
The organization:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	Develops and documents an inventory of information system components that:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.	Accurately reflects the current information system;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.	Includes all components within the authorization boundary of the information system;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.	Is at the level of granularity deemed necessary for tracking and reporting; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.	Includes [Assignment: organization-defined information deemed necessary to achieve effective information system component accountability]; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	Reviews and updates the information system component inventory [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
### CM-8(a) Control Requirement
Describe how the organization develops and documents an inventory of information system components that:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	Accurately reflects the current information system;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	Includes all components within the authorization boundary of the information system;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.	Is at the level of granularity deemed necessary for tracking and reporting; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.	Includes [Assignment: organization-defined information deemed necessary to achieve effective information system component accountability].
### CM-8(a) Control Objective
The objective/ intent of this control is to describe in detail how the CSP accurately captures the inventory of the cloud service offering.

It is highly probable that the information system component inventory is dynamic so that automation is critical for developing and documenting an inventory of information system components. The CSP must describe how the inventory remains (i) accurate; (ii) includes all system components at the (iii) granularity required to track/report at the security level required; and (iv) includes all organization-defined information deemed necessary to achieve effective information system component accountability.

If the inventory of the system is not accurately captured, then every device found within the authorization boundary must be treated as a “defect”.

The CSP must actively manage the operational state of the Cloud Service Offering. One cannot secure what one does not control. (However, the accurate inventory is only one aspect in the secure operational state of the system.) Therefore Hardware Asset Management (HWAM) must “Ensure that unauthorized and unmanaged devices are identified to enable the organization to prevent use by attackers as a platform from which to extend compromise of systems.” Software Asset Management (SWAM) must “Ensure that unauthorized software is identified to prevent use by attackers as a platform from which to extend compromise of systems.”
### CM-8(a) Write the Control
There are four specific develop and document elements that must be adequately described in this security control implementation description.

The description must include the (verb) develop and (verb) document of how the CSP maintains the cloud service offering inventory:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	accurately;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	which includes all system components within the authorization boundary of the information system;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.	at the granularity required to track/report at the security level required; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.	to include all organization-defined information deemed necessary to achieve effective information system component accountability.

The level of detail in the security control implementation detail must be succinct and include all four elements.
### CM-8(a) Customer Responsibility
*IaaS* – This responsibility lies with Service Provider System Specific, or possibly Service Provider Hybrid (Service Provider Corporate and Service Provider System Specific). There is no customer responsibility.

*PaaS* – This responsibility lies with Service Provider System Specific, or possibly Service Provider Hybrid (Service Provider Corporate and Service Provider System Specific). There is no customer responsibility.

*SaaS* – This responsibility lies with Service Provider System Specific, or possibly Service Provider Hybrid (Service Provider Corporate and Service Provider System Specific). There is no customer responsibility.
### CM-8(b) Control Requirement
Describe how the organization reviews and updates the information system component inventory at least monthly or when there is a change.
### CM-8(b) Control Objective
The objective/ intent of this part (b) of this control is to provide a description regarding how the CSP ensures that the CSP provides an accurate information system component inventory to FedRAMP at least monthly or when there is a change to the system. This requirement is for Agency packages and for Joint Authorization Board (JAB) Provisional packages.
### CM-8(b) Write the Control
In part (a) of this control, the description relates to how the cloud service offering system component inventory is kept accurate. This part (b) of the control requires that the frequency be officially defined and then a description of the (noun) process by which the CSP (verb) provides an (noun) accurate information system component inventory to FedRAMP (when?) at least monthly or when there is a change to the system, as per the FedRAMP continuous monitoring requirements.
### CM-8(b) Customer Responsibility
*IaaS* – This responsibility lies with Service Provider System Specific, or possibly Service Provider Hybrid (Service Provider Corporate and Service Provider System Specific). There is no customer responsibility.

*PaaS* – This responsibility lies with Service Provider System Specific, or possibly Service Provider Hybrid (Service Provider Corporate and Service Provider System Specific). There is no customer responsibility.

*SaaS* – This responsibility lies with Service Provider System Specific, or possibly Service Provider Hybrid (Service Provider Corporate and Service Provider System Specific). There is no customer responsibility.
