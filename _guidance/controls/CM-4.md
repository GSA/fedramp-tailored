# CM-4 Security Impact Analysis
## CM-4 Control Requirement
The organization analyzes changes to the information system to determine potential security impacts prior to change implementation.
## CM-4 Control Objective
The objective/ intent of this control is to describe the security impact analysis process and procedures applicable to this system. Each system that participates in the FedRAMP program must have a robust security impact analysis process or procedure integrated into the system change management process. NIST and FedRAMP require that “…Individuals conducting security impact analyses possess the necessary skills/technical expertise to analyze the changes to information systems and the associated security ramifications.”

This means that the security control implementation detail must mention the roles responsible for the security impact analyses for the system at each level of each service layer.
## CM-4 Write the Control
(Verb) Describe the (Noun) security impact analysis process and procedures applicable to this system. Each system that participates in the FedRAMP program must have a robust security impact analysis process or procedure integrated into the system change management process. This security control implementation description must be written so that the 3PAO when testing an example of a security impact analysis to determine the level of analysis completed, versus the level of analysis required, regarding the change to the information system to determine potential security impacts prior to change implementation.

Keep in mind that the level of security impact analysis scrutiny may differ based upon the change made to which level and in which layer of the stack.
## CM-4 Customer Responsibility
*IaaS* – This responsibility lies with Service Provider System Specific, or possibly Service Provider Hybrid (Service Provider Corporate and Service Provider System Specific) but there is no customer responsibility to conduct a security impact analysis. The CSP must conduct the security impact analysis on the CSP system.

*PaaS* – This responsibility lies with Service Provider System Specific, or possibly Service Provider Hybrid (Service Provider Corporate and Service Provider System Specific) but there is no customer responsibility to conduct a security impact analysis. The CSP must conduct the security impact analysis on the CSP system.
