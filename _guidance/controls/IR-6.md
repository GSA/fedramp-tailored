This control requires a description regarding how personnel report suspected security incidents to the organizational incident response capability within the timeframes defined by US CERT.

The incident reporting capability of the CSO and the Agency are separate volumes that must contain all of the required information for all of the Incident Response control family. It is appropriate to paraphrase the security control implementation description and then cite the document. However, it is no acceptable to simply cite the document name and version. Please be aware that is the choice it to cite the document for inclusion in this security control implementation description, the document must be provided as an artifact with the System Security Plan submission.

This control requires that all timeframes are defined within which personnel report suspected security incidents to the organizational incident response capability. Then, there is a requirement that describes how personnel follow this direction and report suspected security incidents to the organizational incident response capability within the organization-defined time period.

This description must provide timeframes and response times at all levels of all service layers for which the CSP is responsible.
