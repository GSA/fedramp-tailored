# IR-4 Incident Handling
## IR-4 Control Requirement
The organization:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	Implements an incident handling capability for security incidents that includes preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	Coordinates incident handling activities with contingency planning activities; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.	Incorporates lessons learned from ongoing incident handling activities into incident response procedures, training, and testing/exercises, and implements the resulting changes accordingly.
### IR-4(a) Control Requirement
Describe how the organization: implements an incident handling capability for security incidents that includes:
  *	Preparation;
  *	detection and analysis;
  *	containment;
  *	eradication; and
  *	recovery.
### IR-4(a) Control Objective
The objective/ intent of this control is to describe at a high level the Cloud Service Offering incident response capability.

The CSO must have an incident response capability and that capability must be clearly articulated with the Agency in order that the Agency may then align that capability with the overall incident management strategy for the Agency.

In part (a) of this control, the requirement is to adequately define and then describe how the CSO Implements an incident handling capability for CSO security incidents that includes (i) preparation, (ii) detection and analysis, (iii) containment, (iv) eradication, and (v) recovery.
### IR-4(a) Write the Control
For this part (a) of this control there are 5 specific sections that must be described.

(i)	Describe how the organization implements an incident handling capability for security incidents that includes preparation
(ii)	Describe how the organization implements an incident handling capability for security incidents that includes detection and analysis
(iii)	Describe how the organization implements an incident handling capability for security incidents that includes containment
(iv)	Describe how the organization implements an incident handling capability for security incidents that includes eradication
(v)	Describe how the organization implements an incident handling capability for security incidents that includes recovery

These descriptions may need to be described for each level of each service layer for which the CSP is responsible. For instance, the incident handling preparation at the Infrastructure layer at the virtualization level is different from the incident handling preparation at the Infrastructure layer at the datacenter level. If the CSO is responsible for the entire stack, the incident response capability at each service layer (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) is handled differently. Each level within each layer is handled according to a system risk management strategy and therefore, each level is most likely handled differently.

Therefore, it may be necessary to cite the organizational incident response capability as a citation (see Consistency Check section, above). However, each layer must still be addressed with enough detail to engender understanding. It is unacceptable to state something to the effect that, “This CSO is protected under Incident Response Capability V1.0, dated NN/NN/NNNN” and offer no detail.
### IR-4(a) Customer Responsibility
*IaaS* - Service Provider System Specific; there is no Customer Responsibility.

*PaaS* - Service Provider System Specific, Provided by Customer (Customer System Specific); It is the responsibility of the customer to include the Service Provider System Specific Incident Response (IR) Plan into the IR Capability and enhance, as necessary for the Agency.

*SaaS* - Service Provider System Specific, Provided by Customer (Customer System Specific); It is the responsibility of the customer to include the Service Provider System Specific Incident Response (IR) Plan into the IR Capability and enhance, as necessary for the Agency.
### IR-4(b) Control Requirement
Describe how the organization: coordinates incident handling activities with contingency planning activities.
### IR-4(b) Control Objective
The objective/ intent of this control part (b) is to ensure that the CSP and the Agency have included the CSO incident response capability into the contingency planning activities. An incident response is a process by which an organization and an Agency respond to data security breaches. It is critical that the incident response plan be included in contingency planning to ensure that organizational data is kept safe and secure. NIST SP 800-61 R2 Incident Handling Guide recommends that incidents are viewed as having a profound effect on the business functions as well as the technical functions. Security incidents have just as critical an impact on a CSO and an Agency as a full blown disaster.
### IR-4(b) Write the Control
(Verb) Describe how the organization (verb) coordinates (noun) incident handling activities with (noun) contingency planning activities for the organization.

Then, the Agency must add detail as to how this aligns with the Incident Response capability and the contingency planning activities for the Agency.
### IR-4(b) Customer Responsibility
*IaaS* - Service Provider System Specific; there is no Customer Responsibility.

*PaaS* - Service Provider System Specific, Provided by Customer (Customer System Specific); It is the responsibility of the customer to include the Service Provider System Specific Incident Response (IR) Plan into the IR Capability and enhance, as necessary for the Agency. This section must include how the CSP IR capability integrated into the contingency planning methodology, aligns with the IR capability and the contingency planning activities for the Agency.

*SaaS* - Service Provider System Specific, Provided by Customer (Customer System Specific); It is the responsibility of the customer to include the Service Provider System Specific Incident Response (IR) Plan into the IR Capability and enhance, as necessary for the Agency. This section must include how the CSP IR capability integrated into the contingency planning methodology, aligns with the IR capability and the contingency planning activities for the Agency.
### IR-4(c) Control Requirement
Describe how the organization:
  *	incorporates lessons learned from ongoing incident handling activities into incident response procedures, training, and testing; and
  *	implements the resulting changes accordingly.
### IR-4(c) Control Objective
The objective/ intent of this part (c ) of this control is to ensure that the CSP and the Agency both view incident response as an evolving process. “Learning and improving” is critical in the incident response arena.  This part (c ) of the control covers
### IR-4(c) Write the Control
Verb) Describe how the (Noun) organization (CSO and the Agency must address) (verb) incorporate and (verb) implement (noun) lessons learned

I.	Describe how the CSO incorporates lessons learned from ongoing incident handling activities into (i) incident response procedures, (ii) training, and (iii) testing.
II.	Describe how the CSO implements the resulting changes from the lessons learned.

Then the Agency must use what the CSO has described for this control and determine how it applies at the Agency level.

I.	Describe how the Agency incorporates lessons learned from ongoing incident handling activities into (i) incident response procedures, (ii) training, and (iii) testing.
II.	Describe how the Agency implements the resulting changes from the lessons learned.

Be sure to adequately describe the integration of lessons learned into IR procedures, training and testing.
### IR-4(c) Customer Responsibility
*IaaS* - Service Provider System Specific; there is no Customer Responsibility.

*PaaS* - Service Provider System Specific, Provided by Customer (Customer System Specific); It is the responsibility of the customer to include the Service Provider System Specific Incident Response (IR) Plan and Lessons Learned into the Agency IR Capability. The Agency incorporates and implements lessons learned from ongoing incident handling activities into (i) incident response procedures, (ii) training, and (iii) testing.

*SaaS* - Service Provider System Specific, Provided by Customer (Customer System Specific); It is the responsibility of the customer to include the Service Provider System Specific Incident Response (IR) Plan and Lessons Learned into the Agency IR Capability. The Agency incorporates and implements lessons learned from ongoing incident handling activities into (i) incident response procedures, (ii) training, and (iii) testing.
