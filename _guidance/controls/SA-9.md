## SA-9 Control Requirement
The organization:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)	Requires that providers of external information system services comply with organizational information security requirements and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employ [Assignment: organization-defined security controls] in accordance with applicable federal laws,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)	Defines and documents government oversight and user roles and responsibilities with regard to external information system services; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)	Employs [Assignment: organization-defined processes, methods, and techniques] to monitor security control compliance by external
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;service providers on an ongoing basis.
### SA-9(a) Control Requirement
Describe how the organization requires that providers of external information system services comply with organizational information security requirements and employ [Assignment: organization-defined security controls] in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.
### SA-9(a) Control Objective
The objective/ intent of this control is to ensure that the CSP describes extent and nature of the chain of trust relationships between themselves and their external providers that are processing, storing, transmitting Federal information in any way, on their behalf. The CSO relationships must be clearly defined to provide assurance that providers meet the same security requirements that federal agencies are required to meet.

For this part (a) of this control, the CSP must make it perfectly clear that all trust relationships (for example, through joint ventures, business partnerships, contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, and supply chain exchanges) meet the same security requirements that federal agencies are required to meet and that the CSP meets. If the CSP is a moderate SaaS that leverages a Moderate PaaS that leverages an IaaS that does not have a FedRAMP authorization, this is a FedRAMP non-compliant trust relationship. It is the responsibility of the CSP to ensure that the chain of trust relationships exist at the criticality level held by the CSP.

The trust relationships must be clearly defined for all levels of all service layers for which the CSP is responsible.
