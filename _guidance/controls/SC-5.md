# SC-5 Denial of Service Protection
## SC-5 Control Requirement
The information system protects against or limits the effects of the following types of denial of service attacks: [Assignment: organization-defined types of denial of service attacks or reference to source for such information] by employing [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards].
### SC-5(a) Control Requirement
Describe how the information system protects against or limits the effects of the following types of denial of service attacks: [Assignment: organization-defined types of denial of service attacks or reference to source for such information] by employing [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards].
### SC-5(a) Control Objective
The objective/ intent of this control is to list and describe how the CSO is protected against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. FedRAMP and NIST allow the CSP to define from which types of DoS attacks (or provide the reference to the source documentation if this information is considered sensitive) they are protected and the mechanisms in place that provide this protection.

The Supplemental Guidance for this control states, “A variety of technologies exist to limit, or in some cases, eliminate the effects of denial of service attacks. For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain types of packets to protect information system components on internal organizational networks from being directly affected by denial of service attacks. Employing increased capacity and bandwidth combined with service redundancy may also reduce the susceptibility to denial of service attacks.”

DoS protection mechanisms must be clearly defined for all levels of all service layers for which the CSP is responsible.

_Software as a Service (SaaS)_
  * Application level
  * Data level

_Platform as a Service (PaaS)_
  * Runtime systems
  * Middleware
  * Databases
  * Operating Systems

_Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)_
  * Virtualization
  * Servers
  * Storage
  * Networking
  * Datacenters
### SC-5(a) Write the Control
This security control implementation detail has two distinct parts:

i.	Describe the types of denial of service attacks or reference to source of such information for the CSP system to protect against or limit the effects.

ii.	Describe the security safeguards used by the system to protect against, or limit the effects of CSP-defined types of denial of service attacks.
### SC-5(a) Customer Responsibility
*IaaS* - Service Provider System Specific. There is no Customer Responsibility.

*PaaS* - Service Provider System Specific. There is no Customer Responsibility.
