The organization:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)  Designates individuals authorized to post information onto a publicly accessible information system;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)  Trains authorized individuals to ensure that publicly accessible information does not contain nonpublic &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;information; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)  Reviews the proposed content of information prior to posting onto the publicly accessible information system &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to ensure that nonpublic information is not included; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)  Reviews the content on the publicly accessible information system for nonpublic information [FedRAMP &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assignment: at least quarterly] and removes such information, if discovered.
### AC-2(a) Control Requirement
Describe how the organization designates individuals authorized to post information onto a publicly accessible information system. 
### AC-2(a) Control Objective
The objective/intent of this control is to ensure that government information posted to publicly accessible websites does not contain nonpublic information. Nonpublic information is any information for which the general public is not authorized access in accordance with federal laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, or guidance. Information protected under the Privacy Act, and vendor proprietary information are examples of nonpublic information. 
### AC-2(a) Write the Control
Keep in mind that this control has four parts. Each part is addressing an aspect of the control. There is no value in repeating information that is already provided.

(Noun) Designated, authorized individuals (Verb) post or publish (Noun) “allowable” information.

Part (a) requires a description of the process by which the organization designates specific individuals who are authorized to post information onto a publicly accessible information system.

Because the general public is not authorized access to nonpublic information (e.g., information protected under the Privacy Act and proprietary information), it is incumbent upon the CSP and the Agency to ensure that those designated individuals responsible for posting information to publicly accessible areas do not inadvertently post information that should not be posted. Posting publicly accessible information must be tightly controlled and monitored within the organization.
### AC-2(a) Customer Responsibilities
*IaaS* - Normally, there is no Customer Responsibility for how the IaaS handles their internal personnel management. Customers are not privy to the intricacies of the IaaS and therefore should not have access for posting nonpublic information regarding the IaaS.

*PaaS* - System accounts are provisioned to customers based upon the subscription and based upon the platform service. Therefore, there could be some clearly defined customer requirements between the IaaS and the customers. It is important to clearly define the Customer Responsibilities as these pertain to the PaaS subscription and if any customer personnel would have access to any information that could be posted to a public website.

*SaaS* - Depending upon the subscription, system accounts are provisioned to customers to perform basic management functions. The Customer Responsibility for having personnel that are authorized to post information to publicly accessible websites may have to be defined depending upon the subscription.
### AC-22(b) Control Requirement
Describe how the organization trains authorized individuals to ensure that publicly accessible information does not contain nonpublic information.
### AC-22(b) Control Objective
The objective/intent of this control is to ensure that government information posted to publicly accessible websites does not contain nonpublic information. Another control to ensure this is to have highly trained personnel who review all information before that information is posted to a publicly accessible website. This aspect of the control focuses on training these individuals. This intends that these designated individuals are included in the AT-2 Security Awareness Training of the organization and that they are specifically trained to handle this data and information as per AT-3 Role-Based Security Training.
### AC-22(b) Write the Control
(Noun) organization (Verb) trains (Noun) authorized individuals

Describe how the organization trains authorized individuals to ensure that publicly accessible information does not contain nonpublic information. As an example, this statement may be a simple paragraph that states that based on part (a) the organization hires individuals with a specific background and then trains the individual over a six month period to become accustomed to the jargon of the organization before the individual is allowed to prep press releases, etc.

Or this may be an involved training whereby it ends with the individual having to be read in before they are allowed to be trained for posting data to publicly accessible web sites.

This will align with AT-2 Security Awareness Training of the organization and AT-3 Role-Based Security Training.
### AC-22(b) Customer Responsibilities
*IaaS* - Normally, there is no Customer Responsibility required of the IaaS customers for how the IaaS handles their internal personnel training. Customers are not privy to the intricacies of the IaaS and therefore have no responsibilities regarding the IaaS.

*PaaS* - System accounts are provisioned to customers based upon the subscription and based upon the platform service. Therefore, there could be some clearly defined customer requirements between the IaaS and the customers regarding personnel training for posting material to publicly accessible websites. It is important to clearly define the Customer Responsibilities as these pertain to the PaaS subscription. If any customer personnel would have access to any IaaS information that could be posted to a public website, then personnel may require training.

*SaaS* - Depending upon the subscription, system accounts are provisioned to customers to perform basic management functions. The Customer Responsibility for training personnel that are authorized to post information to publicly accessible websites may have to be defined depending upon the subscription.
