# PS-3 Personnel Screening
## PS-3 Control Requirement
The organization:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	Screens individuals prior to authorizing access to the information system; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	Rescreens individuals according to [Assignment: organization-defined conditions requiring rescreening and, where &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rescreening is so indicated, the frequency of such rescreening].
### PS-3(a) Control Requirement
Describe how the organization screens individuals prior to authorizing access to the information system.
### PS-3(a) Control Objective
The objective/ intent of part (a) of this control is to ensure that the CSP elaborates upon what type of personnel screening is accomplished before the personnel are allowed system access.  The CSP must be aware that when contracting with the Federal Government it is at the discretion of the partnering Agency to determine what level of personnel screening must be accomplished. Following the Code of Federal Regulations 731-106, all agencies must designate positions at the High, moderate, or low level. Since the CSP is contracting and acting on behalf of the Agency, the CSP is required to follow the Agency requirements for suitability to perform services on behalf of the Agency.
### PS-3(a) Write the Control
This part (a) must describe the initial “screening”.

(Verb) Describe how the (noun) CSP ensures that (noun) individuals/ their personnel are appropriately (verb) background screened (when?) prior to authorizing access to the Cloud Service Offering (CSO).

Describe how the CSP ensures that individuals accessing the CSO which is processing, storing, or transmitting unclassified information are cleared and indoctrinated to the highest classification level of the information to which they have access on the system and to which the Agency has designated as the level for the system.

Potentially, there may be differing background investigation requirements within the CSO at each level of each service for which the CSP is responsible. All differing investigation requirements must be listed and addressed for this control.

### PS-3(b) Control Requirement
Describe how the organization rescreens individuals according to [Assignment: organization-defined conditions requiring rescreening and, where rescreening is so indicated, the frequency of such rescreening].
### PS-3(b) Control Objective
The objective/ intent of this part (b) of this control is to describe the rescreening procedures for individuals with system access.
### PS-3(b) Write the Control
Describe how the CSP rescreens individuals according to the FedRAMP parameters:

For national security clearances; a reinvestigation is required during:
  *	the 5th year for top secret security clearance;
  *	the 10th year for secret security clearance; and
  *	the 15th year for confidential security clearance.

For moderate risk law enforcement and high impact public trust level, a reinvestigation is required during the 5th year. There is no reinvestigation for other moderate risk positions or any low risk positions.

For FedRAMP Tailored, FedRAMP Low baseline, and FedRAMP Moderate baseline except for law enforcement levels, this means that the initial investigation is required as per the responsibility of the partnering agency but there is no requirement for reinvestigation unless “suitability issues develop”.

Therefore, this security control implementation description must address the CSO:

(i)	conditions requiring rescreening

(ii)	frequency of re-screening where it is so indicated

(iii)	provide proof that this rescreening is actually accomplished as defined and at the frequency defined when rescreening is required.
