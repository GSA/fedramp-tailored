# IA-6 Authenticator Feedback
## IA-6 Control Requirement
The information system obscures feedback of authentication information during the authentication process to protect the information from possible exploitation/use by unauthorized individuals.
## IA-6 Control Objective
The objective/ intent of this control is to ensure that authentication feedback cannot be exploited and provide information that would allow unauthorized individuals to compromise authentication mechanisms. For this application, we think of hiding the authentication mechanism with asterisks as the user types in the authenticator. This Authentication Threat is a form of “Eavesdropping” whereby the authenticator secret or authenticator output is revealed to an attacker as the subscriber is authenticating. The Memorized “secrets” are obtained by watching keyboard entry.
